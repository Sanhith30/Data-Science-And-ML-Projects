# Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯

This project is a **machine learning classification task** using the **Sonar dataset**, where the goal is to predict whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine** based on sonar signal data.  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction_Updated.ipynb` → Main Jupyter notebook (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation).  
- `README.md` → Project documentation.  

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Sonar Dataset  
- **Features:** 60 continuous values (sonar signals).  
- **Target:**  
  - `R` → Rock  
  - `M` → Mine  

---

## ⚙️ Steps in the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoding categorical labels (Rock → 0, Mine → 1).  
   - Train-test split.  
   - Standardization of features.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Class distribution visualization.  
   - Feature histograms.  
   - Correlation heatmap.  

3. **Model Training**  
   Implemented multiple machine learning models:
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Gradient Boosting  
   - Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network)  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC Curve & AUC  
   - Precision-Recall Curve  

5. **Model Comparison**  
   - Accuracy comparison across models with bar chart.  

---

## 🚀 Results
- Best performance observed with **[add best model name here]**.  
- Achieved **Accuracy: ~XX%**, **AUC: ~YY**.  
- Models showed trade-offs between precision and recall (especially important in mine detection).
